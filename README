[DESCRIPTION]
Auto Adjust Photo is a tiny command-line image manipulation tool for automatic 
color correction of photos. It tries to make the picture look better. The 
program does this by analyzing the input image and then sets the most optimal 
contrast, gamma, color balance and saturation for it.

REMARKS:
- auto adjust parameter is set by default without any other parameters
- _new file name will be generated without --overwrite parameter
- every file is processed on directory input but not recursively
- order of parameters does not matter
- resize value can be set in percentage too
- resize parameter should be less or equal than original
- resize uses the best (and slowest) resampling method
- default jpeg compression quality is 95%
- EXIF information is restored in jpeg images by default
- number of threads is set to the number of online processors by default
