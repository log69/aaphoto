--------------------
2012/02/20 - aaphoto v0.42 - tiny fix to set PNG compression manually and make it compatible with new version of libpng
2011/01/26 - aaphoto v0.41 - new aaRGB v0.64 version update (see aaRGB changelog)
                           - add -- switch to mark the end of option list for posix compatibility
                           - fix some warnings given by -Wextra compile option
2010/12/18 - aaphoto v0.40 - new aaRGB v0.63 version update
                           - fix some warning messages during build
                           - some changes in documentation
                           - error message when --verbose switch is used with no other ones to avoid misunderstanding
                             that other switches are still needed (aaphoto -V file)
2010/09/14 - aaphoto v0.39 - new aaRGB v0.62 version update
                           - bugfix: an ugly misconception in my paralleled code caused weird behavior when using more threads
                           - bugfix: BMP image writer function didn't zero out the BMP align bytes in file buffer
                             therefore the same output differed in some cases
                           - bugfix: PNG image reader function stored the unreliable values of pixel resolution
                             when the type was unknown
                           - rewrite the code to suffice the ISO C90 ANSI standard C form (GCC -pedantic option)
                           - new windows platform patch of libjasper for static build to replace mkstemp() function call
                             because it is not yet supported under MinGW
                           - some changes in documentation
                           - new default LDFLAG -lgomp for OpenMP

2010/05/10 - aaphoto v0.37 - add OpenMP support for multi processing, all possible time intensive codes paralleled
                             __OPENMP__ directive and -fopenmp option are needed at compile time (supported since GCC v4.2)
                             (not available on windows platform yet)
                           - new -t, --threads switch added to manually set the number of working threads
                           - new aaRGB v0.61 version update
                           - bugfix: exif info was left out after last version's change in JPEG handling
                           - improve exif handling and verbose messages
                           - refine additional verbose messages
                           - remove pgx file type support because it is outdated
                           - some changes in documentation
                           - some minor code cleanup and bugfixes
2010/03/16 - aaphoto v0.36 - bugfix: fix for tmpfile() patches of libjasper and libjpeg (windows platform only)
                             when running more than one instances of aaphoto at a time
                             they all used the same temporary files and therefore the images became corrupt
                           - bugfix: it doesn't ask for administrative privileges anymore while running in an admin account
                             under vista and windows 7 (windows platform only)
                           - bugfix: the --rotate180 switch didn't turn the middle line in images with odd heights
                           - rewrite JPEG format handling entirely to be able to handle extra parameters in this format
                             separately, now libjpeg is used directly instead of libjasper for reading / writing JPEG images
                             so libjpeg is a new dependency from now, formerly only libjasper was depended on it
                           - restore original DPI values of images in BMP, JPEG and PNG formats during conversion
                           - refine program messages
                           - print the time elapsed in seconds since program start in verbose mode if not zero
                           - print extra infos of bitmap dimension, resolution and color depth in verbose mode
2010/02/25 - aaphoto v0.35 - bugfix: possible buffer overflows fixed
2010/02/19 - aaphoto v0.34 - __UNIX__ macro removed from Makefile, not needed anymore
                           - bugfix: static binary update with patches of libjasper and libjpeg
                             1) sleep() function missing on mingw32 platform
                             2) bad implementation of tmpfile() function on windows platform
                                it tries to create temporary files in the root of current directory
                                instead of the system temporary path so that causes failure for unprivileged users
                                who don't have permissions to write there
                           - update: changes in new version of libpng 1.4.0, aaio.c updated as necessary
                                png_check_sig() function replaced with png_sig_cmp()
                                setjmp(png_ptr->jmpbuf) has been deprecated, changed to setjmp(png_jmpbuf(png_ptr))
                                see more at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/src/libpng-1.2.x-to-1.4.x-summary.txt
2010/01/10 - aaphoto v0.33 - some changes in documentation
                           - bugfix: unfreed space caused memory leak
                           - bugfix: uninitialized variable caused --resize to misbehave
                           - fix: change of return values in procedures to reflect standard exit codes
                             now it has a sense to run something like "aaphoto image.jpg && echo OK"
                             formerly return codes meant opposite
                           - fix a warning message during compile time, an include was missing

                           - bugfix: reading corrupt exif info in JPEG files could get into an infinite loop
                           - bugfix: length of exif info was determined wrongly
                           - rework of the parameters and switches parsing part
                           - lots of code cleanup
                           - most of the comments in code translated to english
                           - print messages get flushed out with fflush now during process
                           - the --info switch removed
                           - the -o switch removed for safety reasons, --overwrite still available
                           - the -h switch added for unix compatibility
                           - the -j1 and -j2 switch removed, --jpg and --jp2 still available
                           - the --png switch is now new for PNG output
                           - the -s switch changed from --speed to --silent for compatibility

aaRGB Changelog:
------------------
2011/01/26 - aaRGB v0.64 - the contrast seemed strong with the default initial value of the former algorithm,
                           so now constant optimized to the new contrast algorithm introduced in 0.63
                         - add more detailed explanations to the contrast algorithm (in hungarian)
2010/12/18 - aaRGB v0.63 - include OpenMP defs in aargb.c too for standalone usage
                         - fix some warning messages during build
                         - make embedded test info image look more readable by changing the colors (--test switch)
                         - change saturation algorithm from linear to exponential
                         - improve contrast algorithm to include a self balance mechanism to avoid overexposure
                           on images with large blank areas that have relatively small details
                         - improve color balance algorithm to make it a bit more aggressive by raising the value
                           of the color difference factor of the white and black point to the 3rd power
                         - speed up process by skipping saturation part if no change is needed
                         - some memory allocation check

                           from now they are not scaled to perfect black and white, but to their darkest
                           and brightest color that have maximum saturation to fix overexposure problem
                         - improve saturation algorithm with full floating point computing and HSL conversion
